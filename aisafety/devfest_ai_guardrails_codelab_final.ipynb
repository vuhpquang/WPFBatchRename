        "### What are Safety Guardrails?\n",
        "Safety guardrails are mechanisms and strategies implemented in AI systems to ensure that the behavior of AI agents remains safe, ethical, and aligned with human values. They help prevent harmful actions, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why are Safety Guardrails Important?\n",
        "As AI systems become more powerful and autonomous, the potential risks associated with their deployment also increase. Safety guardrails are essential to:\n",
        "- Prevent misuse and abuse of AI capabilities\n",
        "- Mitigate unintended consequences of AI actions\n",
        "- Ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards\n",

        "- Protect against adversarial attacks and manipulations\n",

        "### Common Safety Guardrail Techniques\n",
        "1. **Input Validation**: Ensuring that user inputs are safe and do not contain harmful content.\n",
        "2. **Output Filtering**: Screening AI outputs to prevent the generation of harmful or sensitive content.\n",
        "3. **Tool Use Restrictions**: Limiting the tools and actions that AI agents can perform based on safety considerations.\n",
        "4. **Session Management**: Protecting conversation history from being poisoned with harmful content.\n",
        "5. **Monitoring and Auditing**: Keeping logs of AI interactions for review and analysis.\n",
